<li><strong>Bokeh:</strong> Interactive visualizations</li>
<li><strong>t-SNE:</strong>  is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that is well-suited for embedding high-dimensional data for visualization in a low-dimensional space of two or three dimensions. Specifically, this technique can reduce the dimension of data while keeping the similarities between the instances.</strong> </li>
