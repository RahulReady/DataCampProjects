# ASL Recognition with Deep Learning
## Motivation
In North America, American Sign Language is used by many deaf and hard of hearing individuals. They do this by using a vast array of hand gestures and body postures. There has been a lot of progress to converting ASL to spoken language, but at a base level, we can start by understanding what letter signs mean and seeing how well a convolutional neural network can classify them.

## Topics Covered

* **TensorFlow/ Keras:** Framework for creating deep learning models and a high level API to abstract low level complexities.
* **Visualizing image pixel data:** Convert arrays to images
* **One hot encoding in Keras:**
* **Convolutional Neural Networks:** Neural network structure to classify image data.

## Steps taken

1. Data understanding and visualization
2. Examine the 'balance' of the dataset
3. One hot encode categorical variables
4. Define a CNN model
5. Compile the model on specified metrics
6. Train and test the model
7. Visualize the errors
