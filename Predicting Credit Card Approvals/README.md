# Credit Card Applications
## Motivation
Banks get a lot of applications for credit cards. Can we use ML techniques to automate the task of manually analyzing each application to approve or deny a credit app? (Spoiler: Yes)

## Topics Covered

* **Missing Value Treatment:** How to handle missing values. Mean? Mode? Median imputation.
* **Min-Max Scaler:** Scaling the data to between 0 and 1
* **Confusion Matrices:** Evaluating predictions
* **GridSearch:** Trying different parameters of a model to find the best one

## Steps taken

1. Data understanding
2. Checking for missing values
3. Replacing missing vals with nan
4. Impute appropriate missing vals
5. Split the data into train and test
6. Scale the data
7. Train a logistic regression model
8. Gridsearch optimal parameters
