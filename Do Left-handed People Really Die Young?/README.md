# Do Left Handed People Really Die Young?
## Motivation
There was a published 1991 article that said left handed people die on average 9 years earlier than right handed people. If that doesn't make you go WTF(what the fudge), then what the fudge??? We need to try and get to the bottom of this. This project will be aimed at answering whether there is some merit to this or this article was a bunch of baloney.

## Topics Covered

* **Applying Bayes Rule:** Given past evidence, what is the probability of future occurances

## Steps taken

1. Data understanding and visualization
2. Check left-handedness over time
3. Apply Bayes rule
4. Plot the distributions of conditional probabilities
5. Compare the average age of right vs left handed people at death
6. State assumptions and conclude
